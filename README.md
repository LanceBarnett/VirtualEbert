## Virtual Ebert
### Predicting Roger Ebert movie ratings thru collaborative filter and supervised learning techniques.
#### Personal project at Zipfian Academy, April 2014

### Description
Since the death of Roger Ebert, millions of people have no reliable way to know which movies are worth seeing and which should be steered clear of. They dispair of a world in which they can't confidently choose what to watch. Virtual Ebert will fill this gap by recommending new movies based on Ebert's own movie review history.
